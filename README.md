# Chat General Rules

(Under construction)


Find here all the rules of the chat of this channel.

In future version of the stream if it works, you will need to write "I accept the rules" in chat to validate that you accept the conditions write here.


Rules, the basic:
- you are more then welcome to hack the stream as soon as it is to help us make it stronger.
- respect the classic rules that are given by other streamer: no nudity, no out low comment, no nazi, no racism ...
  - if your comment is punishable by law or by the stream platform, we will share your id to the requesting authority.
  - all stream chat are recorded on a pc to be able to react post stream.

Rules, Twitch Play:
- Any "fun" sabotage to the game si allows but...
  - Trying to delete a character or a saveguard == perma-ban
  - Trying to format the console or the PC or harms it == perma-ban
  - Trying to go in the menu of the console or the PC for other reason that the game streamed == perma-ban
- Most of the time the chat is not monitor, so a function of community kick of 5-4 hours will be coded in the future.
  - Every kick is monitor by a human after the stream to set action on the kick user if needed or the reporter if it is not justify 
  
_We will try to code some screen detector for console and thread detector for Window to stop the chat control when someone is doing it. But trying to by pass it or be clever on this topic is a perma-ban for all people implied in the action no question asked.  I hope you understand that "sabotage in game" is fun but "sabotage out game" is not what we want for the fun the community.
By the fact that we use macro and keyboard command, there are always a wait to kill the fun and kill the device. _
